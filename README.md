If you want to use docker, a simple `docker-compose up` will start all containers and attach to their logs once everythin
is configured.

## Configuration

The applications need some config variables (in the form of docker environment files).
You may remove the suffix `-sample` from the `*.env-sample` files so that `docker-compose` can use them.
